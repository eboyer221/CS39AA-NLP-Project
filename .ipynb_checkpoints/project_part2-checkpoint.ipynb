    "The variable that I am primarily focused on predicting using comments is the star rating of the professor's overall quality. This is a continuous numerical variable, however it can be conceptually broken up into quality categories. According to RMP’s official standard, a rating of 3.5-5.0 is good, 2.5-3.4 is average and 1.0-2.4 is poor. I would like to determine the terms that distinguish the highest performing professors so I would like to see whether we could structure this initial model as a binary classification problem by dividing the ratings into 'good' and 'bad' with ratings greater than or equal to 3.5 (=>3.5) being categorized as 'good' (1) and ratings lower than 3.5 (<3.5) being categorized as 'bad' (0).
