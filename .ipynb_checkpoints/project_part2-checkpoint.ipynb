    "The variable that I am primarily focused on predicting using comments is the star rating of the professor's overall quality. This is a continuous numerical variable, however it can be conceptually broken up into quality categories. According to RMP’s official standard, a rating of 3.5-5.0 is good, 2.5-3.4 is average and 1.0-2.4 is poor. I would like to determine the terms that distinguish the highest performing professors so I would like to see whether we could structure this initial model as a binary classification problem by dividing the ratings into 'good' and 'bad' with ratings greater than or equal to 3.5 (=>3.5) being categorized as 'good' (1) and ratings lower than 3.5 (<3.5) being categorized as 'bad' (0).

    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes model performed best in predicting positive sentiment -> high precision, recall, and F1-score on both the training and testing sets.\n",
    "It did not perform well in identifying neutral reviews and had low recall on negative reviews which indicates that it failed to categorize several of those correctly.\n",
    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes model did not perform as well as the binary classification models which may support my original theory that neutral sentiment is difficult to distinguish from negative and positive and thus is not a meaningful category to include in this analysis. The difficulty with classifying neutral cases may be due to the subjectivity of the Likert Scale (1-5) or this may simply be due to the class imbalance as there are fewer neutral cases to train on (11% of set). The imbalance of the set may itself, be a reflection of polarization that is endemic to online rating systems which tend to feature either very positive or very negative reviews with fewer moderate ratings."
